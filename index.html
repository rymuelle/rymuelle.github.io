                <h2>Hey! </h2>
                <p>Welcome to the personal site for Ryan Mueller. It's a collection of miscellaneous things I do.</p>

               
                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <div class="main-image">
                    <img src="images/img_20.jpg" alt="Just some ants">
                </div>
                <p>Photography has been my nearly life long hobby of choice, and I hardly travel anywhere without a camera. You'll find a small set of photos semi-arbitrarily selected in the Photo Gallery.</p>

                <h2>Bread Baking</h2>
                <div class="main-image">
                    <img src="images/img_12.jpg" alt="Symmetry Sourdough">
                </div>

                <p>I almost love baking bread more than I like eating it, and I've been known as the "bread guy" at more than one location. I started baking after being inspired by a friend in grad school, and I particularly like baking lean doughs/french breads/sourdoughs like the one pictured above. You'll find some of my recipes on the bread page.</p>

                <h2>Photographic Denoising</h2>
                <div class="main-image">
                    <img src="images/demosaic_denoise/demosacing_demo_15.png" alt="Denoised image">
                </div>

                <p>I have yet to find an photographic denoiser that I really like, so I set out to build one myself! How I'm doing it can be found on the "Learned Demosaicing and Denoising RAW Images" page.</p>

                <h2>Photo Emulsion Project</h2>
                <div class="main-image">
                    <img src="images/hexagon_is_bestagon.png" alt="Hexagon is bestagon">
                </div>

                <p>By far my most ambitious project, I set out to create the first publicly accessible vegan film since the days of collodians. I have invented my own photographic emulsion that has useable sensitivity laboring for a year on my homemade double jet injection setup. Now, I just gotta get the thing to stick to plastic!</p>
