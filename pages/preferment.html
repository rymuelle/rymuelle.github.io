    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
      The "basic" recipe shows the minimal structure needed to produce bread, but there are many areas where we can modify the end product.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe will showcase two "knobs" bakers can turn to affect the end product: the hydration and the inclusion of a preferment. Increasing the hydration will change the structure of the crumb, and the preferment will increase the flavor of fermentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend mixing the preferment the night before you plan on mixing the dough.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>There are only 4 ingredients required for bread, and most of the bread I bake only has those 4:</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Creating the Preferment</h3>
    <p>
      By prefermenting a small amount of the final flour, we can increase the amount of fermentation product in the final bread without fermenting the whole dough ball for an extended period of time. An extended fermentation of the whole dough ball may be desirable—it's up to your personal preference!
    </p>
    <p>
      Smell the dough before and after, it's a smell you'll learn well as a baker, and the strength of it is a valuable signal.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix 100g of the water, 100g of the flour, and a pinch of yeast to form a thick porridge-like mixture.</li>
      <li>Let it sit for 6–12 hours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Mixing the Dough</h3>
    <p>
      This dough is a higher hydration than the basic bread recipe, so it will start a bit stickier—but be patient. It will turn into an elastic dough ball too.
    </p>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Mix the preferment with the remaining 250g of water.</li>
      <li>In another bowl, mix the remaining 400g flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
      <li>Mix the water into the dry ingredients, ensuring no dry clumps remain.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Bulk Rise</h3>
    <p>The rest of this recipe is basically identical to the basic bread one.</p>

    <h4>Stretch and Fold (Repeat 3 Times)</h4>
    <ol start="6">
      <li>Wait 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Wet your hands and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90° between each stretch. 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/QYzxulQY1Gc?t=11" target="_blank">Example video</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the dough again.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Continue Bulk Rise</h4>
    <p>
      Let the dough rise for 1+ hours at room temperature. Alternatively, refrigerate overnight or for up to a few days. The longer and colder the fermentation, the more sour flavor develops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key in this step is to pay attention to the dough. If it's not noticeably swollen with air after an hour, check back in 30 minutes and repeat. Bake to the dough, not to the recipe.
    </p>

    <h3>Proofing</h3>
    <p>
      When the dough is smooth, elastic, and has at least doubled in volume, it’s ready to be shaped and proofed for baking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaping takes practice. If the dough becomes stiff, let it rest for 10–15 minutes. The goal is a ball shape with plenty of surface tension.
    </p>
    <ol start="9">
      <li>Lightly flour the dough and surface, then gently turn it out.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg" target="_blank">Shape the dough into a boule</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Dust with flour and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
      <li>Set two timers: one for 20 minutes, and one for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>After 20 minutes, preheat oven to 450°F.</li>
      <li>
        After 45 minutes, test the dough with a poke: it should be jiggly, not collapse, and rebound slowly. If not ready, wait 15 minutes and try again.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>
      To create steam, cover the loaf with aluminum foil and moisten the surface. Optionally, bake with a pie tin of water or use a Dutch oven for best results.
    </p>
    <ol start="15">
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA" target="_blank">Score the loaf</a> about 3/4" deep with a sharp knife or lame.
      </li>
      <li>Wet the loaf and loosely cover with foil. Add water tray to oven if desired.</li>
      <li>Bake for 35–40 minutes. Remove foil after 25. It’s done when browned and sounds hollow, or reads 190°F internally.</li>
      <li>Let rest 30 minutes before slicing—it’s still cooking inside.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      After baking, observe the differences in crumb, crust, rise, flavor, and aroma. The goal is to build up your toolset to make the bread you want—without relying on recipes.
