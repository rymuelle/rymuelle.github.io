  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>
    This recipe is a minimal version of the most common method for baking bread, but don't think that means the end product isn't high quality. This recipe can produce insanely good baguettes, pizzas, or loaves of bread.
  </p>
  <p>
    The method starts with mixing ingredients and then letting them ferment or rise to develop flavor and build up gas in the dough. During the rise, we will employ stretches and folds to both develop the structure of the dough and monitor its progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, a loaf is shaped and allowed to "proof" before baking. So, this recipe features two fermentation periods: a bulk rise and a proof. More complex recipes may feature more stages, but nearly all recipes will feature these two stages, and shaping and proving bread is the first skill bakers must master.
  </p>

  <h3>A brief explanation on "why" we prove bread:</h3>
  <p>
    When manipulating dough (folding, shaping, kneading), the gluten network tightens and resists change. As the dough rests, it loses its tension and strength. We want to control the tension in the network at the time of baking, so we shape and then rest the dough for a bit so that it has enough tension to not collapse, but not so much that it resists rising and tears.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, I advise paying attention to how the dough feels and behaves in each step. Is it sticky or easy to handle? Does it stretch or deform when pulled? Does it collapse or hold its volume when poked? These properties will change with time, manipulation, and fermentation.
  </p>

  <h3>Last notes</h3>
  <p>Don't stress about doing everything perfect. Essentially, only two things are needed for dough to bake into bread:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A glutinous network that can hold air</li>
    <li>Air trapped within that network</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If those two things are met, you will bake bread. The most common failure is that the network either contains too little air, resulting in dense bread, or it has sat too long and can no longer hold air. The good news is that there's a fairly large window of time where things will still work well.
  </p>
  <p>
    ...And even if it does collapse (e.g. it is overproofed), you can just reshape it and try again or bake it as a flat bread.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>There are only 4 ingredients required for bread, and most of the bread I bake only has those 4:</p>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A high-protein (read: gluten) flour is ideal. Recommended: King Arthur Flour (KAF). Bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose, but KAF all-purpose is high enough and too high can result in tougher bread.</li>
    <li>Hydration percentage is the main knob a baker can turn to modify their bread. This bread is at 65% hydration (325 g water / 500 g flour). You could make this bread anywhere from 55% to 85% hydration and get very different, but good, results. 70% is a good default, but 65% is a bit easier to work with.</li>
    <li>Salt is salt. It doesn’t really matter what kind you use, but some people dislike the taste of iodized salt.</li>
    <li>Any yeast works. I recommend buying a jar of instant or active dry. Way cheaper than the packets, and it will last forever in the freezer.</li>
    <li>Using a kitchen scale is highly recommended, but you can convert to volume measurements if needed.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You’ll also want:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A bowl</li>
    <li>A cloth</li>
    <li>A baking sheet</li>
    <li>Parchment paper</li>
    <li>A kitchen scale</li>
    <li>A rigid spoon</li>
    <li>Some aluminum foil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Mixing</h3>
  <p>Just mix the ingredients until combined.</p>
  <p>Note: Try wetting your hands and pulling the dough ball apart. It will fall apart easily at this stage. Also note how dense and sticky the dough is.</p>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix briefly with a sturdy spoon.</li>
    <li>Form a little depression in the middle of the flour and pour in the water.</li>
    <li>Mix the flour and water with the spoon until a shaggy ball with no large dry clumps remain.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent drying.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Bulk Rise</h3>
  <p>The goal of this step is to generate the bread’s internal structure and ferment it, producing gas and flavor.</p>

  <h4>Stretch and Fold (Repeat 3 Times)</h4>
  <p>Note how much more elastic the dough becomes after just 15 minutes. Also note how the dough ball tightens when you stretch and fold it.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>Wait 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>
      Remove the cover, wet your hands, and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90° between each stretch.

    </li>
    <li>Cover the dough again.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Continue Bulk Rise</h4>
  <p>
    The dough should now be smooth and elastic, and maybe very slightly filled with air. Let the dough rise for 1+ hours at room temperature. Alternatively, place it in the fridge overnight (or up to a few days). The longer and colder you ferment, the more sour flavor will develop.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key in this step is to pay attention to the dough. Check the dough after one hour. If it does not seem noticeably swollen with air, check back in 30 minutes and repeat. Bake to the dough, not to the recipe.
  </p>

  <h3>Proofing</h3>
  <p>
    When the dough is smooth, elastic, and has at least doubled in volume, it’s ready to be shaped and proofed for baking. Proofing optimizes the amount of air and surface tension in the dough before baking.
  </p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>Lightly flour the top of the dough and your hands. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg" target="_blank">Shape the dough into a boule (ball)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Dust the top with flour and cover with the damp cloth.</li>
    <li>Set two timers: one for 20 minutes, and another for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>After 20 minutes, preheat your oven to 450°F.</li>
    <li>After 45 minutes, check the dough’s proof by poking with a wet finger. It should rebound slowly but not collapse.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Baking</h3>
  <p>
    Steaming the bread creates a nice crust. We’ll emulate that with foil and moisture. If you have a dutch oven, even better. Scoring helps control the rise.
  </p>
  <ol start="13">
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA" target="_blank">Score the loaf</a> with a sharp knife or razor.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle water over the top and cover loosely with foil. Add a tray of water to the oven if desired.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35–40 minutes. Remove foil after 25 minutes. It’s done when browned, hollow sounding, or 190°F+ inside.</li>
    <li>Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It should rise beautifully and develop a crisp crust. If you hear crackling as it cools, that's called "singing" — a sign of good crust.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic Troubleshooting:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>If the crust rips, it was underproofed.</li>
    <li>If it collapses, it was overproofed.</li>
    <li>If it’s pale and dense, it needed more fermentation/air.</li>
  </ol>
